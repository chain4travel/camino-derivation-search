# Derivation search script

This script needs a seed phrase and runs through the predefined Camino/Avalanche derivation paths to search for a specific match with a P-Chain address. When it finds a match, it then prints out the derivation path and the respective public/private key for that path.

The script can also be modified to print out more/different paths.
